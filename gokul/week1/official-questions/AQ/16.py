# Accept a positive integer,
# x , as input from the user. Without using the * symbol anywhere in your code, print 
# 10 * 𝑥, i.e. the product of the integer input and the number 10.

# x = int(input())
# result = 0
# for _ in range(10):
#     result += x
# print(result)

x = int(input())
print((x << 1)+(x <<3))
