# Write a code to accept the name of a person as input and print the initials as output. Assume that the name will be of this form: <first name> <last name> . Also assume that the first name and last name will be a single word, and there will be exactly one space between the two

# names. For example, if the input is Rohit Sharma, the output should be RS.

full_name = input("Enter your full name (first and last): ")
first_name, last_name = full_name.split(" ")
initials = first_name[0].upper() + last_name[0].upper()
print(initials)
