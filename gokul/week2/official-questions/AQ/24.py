# A data entry operator at a telephone exchange is using a faulty keyboard — the zero key is missing — to enter phone numbers into an application. 
# As a workaround, he uses the capital letter "O" wherever there is a zero in the phone number. 
# Write a program to accept one of these phone numbers and convert all the "O"s to zeros.
# In the next week, we will see how to fix all the phone numbers with few more lines of code.
